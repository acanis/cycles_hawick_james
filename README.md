Port from D to C++ (STL) by Andrew Canis (Sept 2013)

Usage
-----

    make
    echo "0 1\n0 2\n1 0\n1 3\n2 0\n3 0\n3 1\n3 2" | ./circuits_hawick 4

First argument is the number of vertices. Ordered pairs of space separated
vertices are given via standard input and make up the directed edges of the
graph.

DOT file input
--------------

For simplicity, there is no DOT file parser included but the following allows
to create a suitable argument string and standard input for simple DOT graphs.

Given a DOT file of a simple (no labels, colors, styles, only pairs of
vertices...) directed graph, the following lines generate the number of
vertices as well as the edge list expected on standard input.

        sed -n -e '/^\s*[0-9]\+;$/p' graph.dot | wc -l
        sed -n -e 's/^\s*\([0-9]\) -> \([0-9]\);$/\1 \2/p' graph.dot

The above lines work on DOT files like the following:

    digraph G {
      0;
      1;
      2;
      0 -> 1;
      0 -> 2;
      1 -> 0;
      2 -> 0;
      2 -> 1;
      }

They would produce the following output:

    3
    0 1
    0 2
    1 0
    2 0
    2 1

Figure 10: 22 Circuits found in the network shown in figure 9 which has 16
nodes and 32 arcs and allows self-arcs. Note there are repeated circuits due to
the presence of a multiple-arc connecting nodes 12 and 1.

The input graph, which is shown in figure 9, can be given as an input to the
program using above format as follows:

    echo "0 2\n0 10\n0 14\n1 5\n1 8\n2 7\n2 9\n3 3\n3 4\n3 6\n4 5\n4 13\n\

    12 14\n13 3\n13 12\n13 15\n14 11\n15 0" | ./circuits_hawick 16
